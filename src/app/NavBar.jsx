/*
    NavBar is used to place all of your NavLinks
    Each NavLink acts like a redirect button, but will
    tell the Router Switch to switch the page WITHOUT
    needing to refresh the page.

    This makes for a better experience for the user and
    also helps us maintain our states while the user is 
    moving between pages

    NavLink takes one main argument you will need
        to="/path"
    
    Like all other components you can also pass className

    When you want to have certain links show up depending 
    on the Apps state (like in an instance of a user being
    loggedIn or out) use the conditional statement
        {boolean && <NavLink>}
    if you would like multiple components just make sure
    to wrap it in a <Fragment>
        {boolean && <Fragment><NavLink/><NavLink/><NavLink/></Fragment>}

    Fragment is imported here to show you an example of how
    to import it to react.
